This is my website, named EX2, it stands for "experiment 2", my first one was EX1, it was never released to the public, then i made an improved version of EX1 and decided to put it up, so here it is.
EX2 is a search engine, well, more like a homepage, one you go to it well, youl see, but there is a input box under the clock, enter what you want to search and press the [S] button, it is the search button, and it will run a search through google and get your information.
